# Spy Game
Spy Game (also known as "Who's the Spy?") is a popular social deduction game! Each player is given a location, 
but one player is secretly assigned the role of the spy and doesn’t know the location. 
The spy’s goal is to figure out the location without revealing their identity, while the other players try to deduce who the spy is. 
Each player takes turns asking questions that hint at the location, but the questions shouldn't be too obvious, or the spy might catch on easily.
The game requires the spy to carefully listen and figure out clues from the questions while the other players attempt to uncover the spy’s identity. 
At the end of the round, players guess who they think the spy is, and if they’re correct, the game ends.
